```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Create a 2 col array balanced at zero

```{r}
x=seq(from=-10,to=10,by=2)
y=x
tot=sum(x*y)
tot
```
benchmark

now got thru a loop of permuting y and capturing the product into a bucket.

```{r}
bucket=numeric()
for (i in 1:1000){
  z=sample(y,size = length(x))
  bucket[i]=sum(x*z)
}
```
```{r}
summary(bucket)
plot(density(bucket))
```
  
#Conclusion - The largest sum of products occurs when the numbers are paired with each other. Any other permutation of the y's with the x's yields a smaller number (in absolute value). The sum product is basically the correlation. (un-normalized)
